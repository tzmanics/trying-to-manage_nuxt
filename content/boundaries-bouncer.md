For so many reasons, you need to set boundaries for your team. To name a few:
- keeping the team focused on the tasks at hand
- avoiding too many/not relevant meetings
- helping solidify the purpose of the team and your work
- that whole mental wellbeing thing, heard of it?

It's up to me, as the manager, to set those boundaries for the team. Although I have a good idea of what our boundaries should be, I always check in with the team to see if they agree or if they have more stipulations they want to add. What is most important to me is that I take on the difficult or uncomfortable conversations that have to happen to set those boundaries and that the team knows they can push any questions about our boundaries to me.

Here are some ways I set boundaries:
- *process*: I know, it's totally my favorite word (besides "bonkers") BUT I've found that if I add specifications in process docs (e.g. before a proposal can be submitted it must )
