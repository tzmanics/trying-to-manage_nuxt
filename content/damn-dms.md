# Damn DMs

_Stop time sucks by kicking people out out of your teams DMs._

---

One of the biggest time sucks I have ever seen are DM requests and questions. Worse yet, this tends to be invisible work because it's happening inside people's DMs and we don't usually have a weekly check-in asking, "Sooo what DMs are you getting?" I mean ruuuude!
